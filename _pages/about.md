<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science at Shaanxi Normal University. I come from Mengzi City, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, and my specialties are volleyball, piano, and traditional Chinese calligraphy with a writing brush。

I am quite interested in chemistry and aim to realize intelligent chemistry through computer science to deduce the principles of chemical reactions. Meanwhile, I have also participated in a research project on Web3 and blockchain. Of course, I am a complete beginner with no prior experience and hope to further my learning in this field.
